Simply put, \\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different \\nregions of space -time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.). \\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the \\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in \\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the \\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space -\\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a \\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to \\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a \\nwormhole wou ld collapse the moment it forms by \\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize \\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter” \\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density, \\nis required. Although this substance exists \\nmathematically, it  hasn’t been detected in the \\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However, \\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of \\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum \\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic \\nmatter” may not be requi red to stabilize the tunnel. If \\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then \\nquantum information entering the black hole will be \\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part \\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss of informatio n in a black hole (Wolchover, 2017). \\nHowever, as none of this research has empirical \\nevidence, no definitive claims can be made. As the \\nname suggests , white holes are fundamentall \\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to \\nescape from a black hole,  it would be impossible to \\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and \\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed \\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is \\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole \\nwould almost be like a  “time reversal” of viewing a \\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at \\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly \\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence of a \\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a \\nwormhole would be re quired to exist inside the black \\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As \\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to \\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second \\nlaw of thermodynamics –entropy (a measure of how \\nmany different  states particles in a system can be in) \\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can \\nincrease; however.  computer  programs  to solve  \\ncomplex  problems  by applications  of processes  that \\nare analogo\\nAccording to the current mining situation and the bottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined ', metadata={'source': 'Ai.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Prior to \\nCOVID -19 pandemic, maternal health was \\nalready affected by increased maternal mortality \\nand morbidity attributed to decreased so cial-\\neconomic status, cultural values and geographical \\nremoteness. These factors increase the risk for \\npregnancy -related illnesses, negative \\nconsequences after birth and maternal death more \\nin developing countries than in developed \\ncountries.
